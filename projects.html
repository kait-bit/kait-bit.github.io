                    <p>Through this assignment, I learned how to access and request software from my school. I faced difficulty finding all of the software through the portal, such as Adobe Express, but I was able to access it through their website to complete the assignment. The Adobe Express access ended up being very helpful throughout the semester for creating flyers and other graphics. I used it to create the cards on the homepage of this website.</p>
                    <p>After this assignment, I better understood the technologies available to me as a Penn State student.</p>

                    <p>This tutorial was interesting to me because I learned about prompt engineering, which I was not aware existed. I decided to use a prompt designed for meal planning because it is something I do frequently and would love to make easier. Getting used to detailing every aspect of the desired response was new to me and challenging at first, but once I got used to it I found it very helpful.</p>
                    <p>I now see how prompt engineering makes AI easier to use and helps prevent undesirable responses. My AI skills are stronger, which will likely come in handy in the future.</p>

                    <p>Choosing devices to deconstruct virtually was very exciting! I picked a Nintendo Switch because it is a device I use often. For the laptop, I chose one that looked similar to one I had in the past because I could not find a desktop gaming computer like I own. Many of the components of the laptop were familiar to me after building my own computer, but the Switch was more difficult to decode.</p>
                    <p>I learned how different the components of different devices can look, especially if they are small and compact. Now, I am able to better identify hardware components of computers and other devices.</p>
